What is your favorite movie?
As far as recent movies, I'm pretty partial to the marvel cinematic universe - I'd have to say the original Captain America, but I was super impressed with the way endgame was put together too.
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
I've never done the stereotypical high school/college tour of Europe, and I think seeing all of that would be pretty cool
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
I'd have to go with teleporation. I spent the last two summers commuting an hourand a half to and from my internship, so being able to travel instantly would be fantastic.
